# Classifying Isolated Spring-Mass Networks: Time Series Classification

This repo contains code related to spring mass networks. There is code to simulate the dynamics of 2-d spring-mass networks in 3 different topologies (3 masses, 5 masses, and 9 masses) with arbitrary spring constants. The dynamics do not include damping or noise. There is code to classify the trajectory of individual masses as belonging to a specific network. The classifiers were highly effective.

Below are some short videos that visualize the classification problem:
